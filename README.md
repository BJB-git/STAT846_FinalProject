# Introduction
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric classification technique that makes no assumptions about the shape of decision boundaries. It is easy to implement and often performs well despite its simplicity.  

Classification algorithms operate on data where each case belongs to a class (or category) along with having several other known categorical or quantitative attributes. We often know which class some cases belong to (these cases are called our training data) but do not know the classes of other cases (called our test data). KNN predicts classes in the test data by examining known variables and seeing which cases in the test set are the “closest” (using a defined distance metric) to cases with known classifications in the training data. The number of other cases considered in this comparison is called the “k value”, and the closest cases in the training set are called the “nearest neighbors”. Smaller k values generally produce more flexible models with easy-to-compute results.  

Many R packages offer functions that implement the KNN algorithm, presenting users with a wide range of choices to consider. This report examines seven available implementations and provides recommendations on the best overall function and specific situations where other functions should be considered. HIV treatment data is used to test the performance of each package so that direct comparisons can be made. 

## Description of Example Dataset 

The Data used is from “The HIV Drug Resistance Database” built by a Stanford team.
The sample size is 1246.
The outcome is Resistance information of 5 drugs in the NRTI class. 

In this data set, there are 228 mutations of each isolate/virus and five predictors that represent five different drugs. 
These drugs are Lamivudine (3TC), Abacavir (ABC), Zidovudine (AZT), Stavudine (D4T) and Didanosine (DDI). 
These response variables have been changed to binary variables using specified cut-off values suggested by biologists.   


# Overview of Evaluation Criteria 

Each KNN function is evaluated based on the following criteria: 
* Prediction accuracy 
Algorithm robustness 
Runtime (speed)/computational efficiency  
Ease of use 
Other features of the functions (output options, built-in data processing, missing data handling, etc.)
